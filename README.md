# FlashCards

Step up your learning with digital flashcards that can be played through easily in your terminal. For a given deck of flashcards, you can cycle through each card, select an answer, and see if it was correct. When the whole deck has been played through, you will be alerted to the percentage of answers you got correct.

## Install/Setup

Fork and clone down the repo and cd into it via your terminal. Then, run `node index.js` to initiate the playthrough of the flashcards. You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards and see how well you did at the end.
